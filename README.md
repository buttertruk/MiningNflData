# MiningNflData

This project uses several Python Data Mining and Analysis libraries to create clustering and classifying algorithms to analyze NFL players for fantasy football players. This was a final project for Data Mining.
The current cluster algorithm works only for running backs. The classify algorithm is looking at rbs, wrs, te, and qb. Jitter is the output of the clustering algorithm when using the bokeh library.

## To install and run, you need to following:

'''
python version 2.7+
bokeh (python library, can be installed using pip)
nfldb (python library, can be installed using pip)
'''

### Note:

nfldb will need to be set up on your machine with some extra steps. A database will store the player data that you can then pull from to run queries and mine the data further. The steps for this process can be found at the github docs for nfldb.
